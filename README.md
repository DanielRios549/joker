## Joker Stream Website

**This is a project I started in 2014 to practice, it was started without using Git and I stop working on it in 2017. Going back now, maybe changing the purpose of it.**

**This is an unfinished project, A lot of parts are unfinished and do not work properly, I keep the code here because I spent too much time on it and the code can help someone else, including myself.**

### IMPORTANT

**The v√≠deos folder ("media/movies" and 'media/series) are both untracked due to its size. They will be created after the first addition.**
